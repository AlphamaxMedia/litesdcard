[> Intro
--------
LiteSDCard is a small footprint and configurable embedded logic analyzer that you
can use in your FPGA and aims to provide a free, portable and flexible
alternative to vendor's solutions!

LiteSDCard is part of LiteX libraries whose aims are to lower entry level of
complex FPGA cores by providing simple, elegant and efficient implementations
of components used in today's SoC such as Ethernet, SATA, PCIe, SDRAM Controller...

The core uses simple and specific streaming buses and will provides in the future
adapters to use standardized AXI or Avalon-ST streaming buses.

Since Python is used to describe the HDL, the core is highly and easily
configurable.

LiteSDCard is built using LiteX and uses technologies developed in partnership with
M-Labs Ltd:
 - Migen enables generating HDL with Python in an efficient way.
 - MiSoC provides the basic blocks to build a powerful and small footprint SoC.

LiteSDCard can be used as LiteX library or can be integrated with your standard
design flow by generating the verilog rtl that you will use as a standard core.
